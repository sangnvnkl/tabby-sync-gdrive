## 🚀 Advanced Features

### ⏳ Time Machine (Version History)

Mistakes happen! This plugin keeps a history of your configuration versions on Google Drive.

- Go to **Settings** -> **Google Drive Sync**.
- Click on **Time Machine (Version History)**.
- Browse past versions and click **Restore** to roll back to any previous state.

### 🛣️ Smart Path Mapping

Sync your background images and working directories across different operating systems seamlessly.

- Local paths like `C:\Users\Admin\wallpapers\bg.jpg` are automatically converted to `$TABBY_SYNC_HOME/wallpapers/bg.jpg` when syncing.
- When downloading on macOS/Linux, it automatically maps back to `/Users/admin/wallpapers/bg.jpg`.
- Works for **Terminal Backgrounds**, **Profile CWD**, and **Shell paths**.

### 🧩 Plugin Synchronization

Never forget which plugins you had installed.

- The plugin syncs the list of your installed plugins.
- If you move to a new machine, it will warn you about **Missing Plugins** so you can install them to match your setup.

Fully supports syncing snippets/commands created with the popular `quick-cmds` plugin. Your productivity scripts follow you everywhere.
